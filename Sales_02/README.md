## Introduction

This project highlights the power and flexibility of Advance Excel for multi-page dashboard design using functions and formulas with power tools like Power Query and Power Pivot. It also showcases the programming of an animated dashboard filter with VBA and Macros.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a fully functional interactive multi-page dashboard that leverages on the power and flexibility of Advance Excel using customized charts, VBA and Macros.

- **Primary Goal:** Develop an interactive multi-page dashboard that summarizes data from a dataet with the use of power tools, VBA and Macros.
- **Business Focus:** Provide insights and actionable recommendations to drive business strategy.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Advance Excel Functions and Formulas:** Utilize various built-in Excel functions (e.g., `SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX/MATCH`, etc.) to analyze the dataset.
- **Data Structuring:**
  - Use a whole range or convert your data into a table for dynamic analysis.
  - Ensure your formulas update automatically as new data is added.
- **Dashboard Elements:** Create a visually appealing and easy-to-read dashboard using slicers, charts, conditional formatting, and clear labeling.

## Road Map

   - Example functions include `SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, and logical functions like `IF` and `AND`.

2. **Select a Whole Range or Turn Your Data into a Table:**
   - Convert raw data into a structured table to enable dynamic range references and facilitate easier data management.

3. **Add Interactivity with VBA and Macros:**
   - Write VBA and Macros to add interactivity to the dashboard filter.
   - Ensure the dashboard is clear and easy to understand. Avoid clutter and use visual elements that make the data immediately comprehensible.
