## Introduction

As a new data analyst at **Home Luxury Kitchen**, a company that sells kitchen equipment, you have been given a dataset containing data from 2019 to 2022, the sales manager wants you to create a dashboard that summaries the sales performance during the period.

You are requested not to use Pivot Tools like Power Table to create the dashboard.

## Project Objective
The objective of the project is to create a fully functional interactive sales dashboard in Advance Excel using only functions and formulas without the use of power tools like Power Query and Power Pivot.

- **Primary Goal:** Develop a dashboard that summarizes from a dataet without the use of power tools.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Advance Excel Functions and Formulas:** Utilize various built-in Excel functions (e.g., `SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX/MATCH`, etc.) to analyze the dataset.
- **Data Structuring:**
  - Use a whole range or convert your data into a table for dynamic analysis.
  - Ensure your formulas update automatically as new data is added.
- **Dashboard Elements:** Create a visually appealing and easy-to-read dashboard using charts, conditional formatting, and clear labeling.
- **No Pivot Tables:** Focus on using formulas and manual chart setups instead of Pivot Tables.

## Road Map
1. **Use Excel Functions and Formulas:**

   - Leverage a variety of Excel functions to calculate totals, averages, and other key metrics.
   - Example functions include `SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, and logical functions like `IF` and `AND`.

   - Think about the business impact and how to best communicate the data.

4. **Make it Simple:**
   - Ensure the dashboard is clear and easy to understand. Avoid clutter and use visual elements that make the data immediately comprehensible.
   - Focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) that truly matter to the business.

5. **Make Recommendations for the Business:**
   - Based on your analysis, provide actionable insights and recommendations.
   - Consider aspects such as product performance, market trends, and potential areas for cost savings or revenue growth.

- **Key Metrics Summary:** Display total sales, average order value, number of orders, etc.
- **Visual Charts:** Use line charts, bar charts, and other visuals to depict trends and comparisons.
- **Detailed Breakdown:** Provide additional insights like top-selling products, regional performance, and sales by sales channel.
- **Recommendations:** Clearly highlight strategic recommendations based on the data analysis.

## Conclusion
